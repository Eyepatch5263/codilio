Codilio is a SaaS project where users can perform code execution for free for one language, JavaScript. The platform offers 9 other languages which users can access by paying a small amount. Users can keep track of their code executions in their profile section and see stats like different code languages, most favorite language, saved code snippets, and total code runs. They can also share snippets, star any snippets to save them for later use, and comment on any code snippet.
